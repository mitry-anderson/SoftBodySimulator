# SoftBodySimulator

This project, completed for the course MECHENG 599: Introduction to Robotic Manipulation at the 
University of Michigan taught by Nima Fazeli, explores the use of a mass spring particle model 
to simulate the mechanics of various deformable objects bouncing on a flat surface, geared 
toward future applications in a manipulation pipeline.

For a full explanation of the project, see the report in this GitHub Repository.

To run a simulation, simply run the python script project.py. To change the object being
simulated, simply edit the file name for the "objectFile" at the top of the script. Some such
png files are provided in the shapes folder, and some animations I generated are in the 
animations folder. Enjoy watching the shapes wiggle and bounce!
