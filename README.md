# SoftBodySimulator

This project, completed for the course MECHENG 599: Introduction to Robotic Manipulation at the 
University of Michigan taught by Nima Fazeli, explores the use of a mass spring particle model 
to simulate the mechanics of various deformable objects bouncing on a flat surface, geared 
toward future applications in a manipulation pipeline.

For a full explanation of the project, see the report in this GitHub Repository.
